Description: Write a function that returns the windchill index. Your code should ensure that the restriction on the temperature is not violated. Look up some weather reports in back issues of a newspaper in your university library and compare the windchill index you calculate with the result reported in the newspaper. W = 13.12 + 0.6215 * t â€“ 11.37 * v0.16 + 0.3965 * t * v0.016
